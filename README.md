Task-oriented dialogue systems have four modules. the first component is Natural Language Understanding (NLU). in this component, we want to know the user's intent from what he or she says. for example, if the user says, "I want low-fat milk, " the NLU module must understand that the user wants to buy something and that is a bottle of milk with low fat. 
in this work, I used the RASA framework to train an NLU model in the Persian language for supermarket conversations between customers and sellers. these conversations are just in two domains of products dairy and drinks. as you see results of evaluations are pretty good.
